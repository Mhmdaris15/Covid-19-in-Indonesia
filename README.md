## Context
The COVID-19 dataset in Indonesia was created to find out various factors that could be taken into consideration in decision making related to the level of stringency in each province in Indonesia.

## Content
Data compiled based on time series, both on a country level (Indonesia), and on a province level. If needed in certain provinces, it might also be provided at the city / regency level.

Demographic data is also available, as well as calculations between demographic data and COVID-19 pandemic data.
